## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r HW5}
load("~/Downloads/house_prices.rda")
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)

# 1a
house_prices$year <- year(house_prices$date)

ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = year, y = house_price_index, group = state)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~state) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1980, 2000, 2020), labels = c("'80", "'00", "'20")) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "House Price Index", title = "House Price Index Trend by State") +
  theme_minimal()

# 1b
house_reshaped <- house_prices %>%
  gather(key = "measure", value = "value", house_price_index, unemploy_perc, -state, -date, -year)

# 1c
ggplot(house_reshaped, aes(x = year, y = value, color = measure, group = interaction(state, measure))) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~state) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1980, 2000, 2020), labels = c("'80", "'00", "'20")) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Value", color = "Measure", title = "Trends for House Price Index and Unemployment Percentage by State") +
  theme_minimal()
#This graph effectively shows the trends for both house_price_index and unemploy_perc across states. However, plotting two unrelated measures on the same axis can lead to confusion, as the scales and trends for each may differ significantly.
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(house_prices, aes(x = year, y = house_price_index, group = state)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~state) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1980, 2000, 2020), labels = c("'80", "'00", "'20")) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "House Price Index", title = "House Price Index Trend by State") +
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(house_reshaped, aes(x = year, y = value, color = measure, group = interaction(state, measure))) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~state) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1980, 2000, 2020), labels = c("'80", "'00", "'20")) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Value", color = "Measure", title = "Trends for House Price Index and Unemployment Percentage by State") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
